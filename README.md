# Typescript React template

Start your Typescript React project with this template. It contains the bare
minimum to start writing a new Web application.

## Prepare

Clone this repository and install dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/PeWu/ts-react-template.git my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

Start with editing the following lines:
- in `package.json`, change the `"name"` value
- in `index.html`, change the page `<title>` tag

## Run locally

During development, run a local server like this:
```
npm start
```

A browser tab should open automatically with your application served at
http://localhost:3000. The page will reload automatically when you change
the source files.

## Build and deploy

When you are ready to deploy your application, run:
```
npm run build
```

Now you can deploy the contents of the `build/` folder to a web server.
